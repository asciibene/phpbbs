<h2>About phpbbs</h2>
<p>Welcome to a new kind of bulletin board(forum).
I am developing phpBBS during my free time (I have alot of it unfortunately) solely with the use of a bluetooth keyboard along with an Android smartphone; i.e. no computer.<br> All that using rudimentary tools being pushed to their limit on <a class="nlk" href="./specs.html">constrained hardware</a>. It is designed with the most minimalistic of attitudes and will stay that way.<br>
I am confident that this website is hackable, also probably unoptimized. The code used to run this website is only a few <del>weeks</del> months old.Nevertheless, it will keep evolving regularly for as long as I can maintain it; adding new features as time passes.<br>
<br>
PHPBBS is being maintained by <a href="http://asciibene.tx0.org">ASCII Bene</a>. Feel free to send me your ideas and tell me how I could improve phpBBS at ->
