<h2>About phpbbs</h2>
<p>Welcome to a new kind of bulletin board(forum).
I am developing phpBBS solely with the use of a tablet and smartphone; i.e. no computer. All using rudimentary tools being pushed to their limit on <a class="nlk" href="./specs.html">constrained hardware</a>. It is designed with the most minimalistic of attitudes and will stay that way. I am confident that this website is hackable, also unoptimized. The code used to run this website is only a few weeks old, yet it will keep evolving regularly for as long as I can program code for it, adding new features as time passes. Also feel free to send me your ideas and tell me how I could improve phpBBS at ->
