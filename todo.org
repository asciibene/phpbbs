* TODO *phpwiki*

** List
note : use static variable

- important but unsure :: implement pages agus users as objects instead of arrays
    - because objects can carry methods which are useful


- make admin tools 
    -admin god account
     
- +make page editor+
   - although fix it so can edit already existing pages
       - somewhat done but *fix double linebreak*
   
- post viewer
    - improve layout style

- _minor fixes_
    - /eventually/ change foreach() constructs for something faster...
 
    
    
:LESSIMPORTANT:    
- /eventually convert global funcs to objects/
